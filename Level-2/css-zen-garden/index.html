        <h3>THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMENT</h3>
        <br />
        Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific
        tags, incompatible <u>DOM</u>s, broken <u>CSS</u> support, and abandoned
        browsers.
        <br />
        <br />
        We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved
        thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the <u>W3C</u>, <u>WASP</u>,
        and the major browser creators.
        <br />
        <br />
        The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important
        lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the
        time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with
        the web.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</h3>
        <br />
        There is a continuing need to show the power of <u>CSS</u>. The Zen
        Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin,
        view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will
        load the style sheet into this very page. The <u>HTML</u> remains the
        same, the only thing that has changed is the external <u>CSS</u> file.
        Yes, really.
        <br />
        <br />
        <u>CSS</u> allows complete and total control over the style of a
        hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that
        gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the
        reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from
        structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of
        the web; we can always push it further.

            <h3>PARTICIPATION</h3>
        <br />
        Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this
        page, so strong <u>CSS</u> skills are necessary too, but the example
        files are commented well enough that even <u>CSS</u> novices can use
        them as starting points. Please see the
        <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/resources/"
          ><u>CSS</u> Resource Guide</a
        >
        for advanced tutorials and tips on working with <u>CSS</u>.
        <br />
        <br />
        You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the
        <u>HTML</u>. This may seem daunting at first if you’ve never worked this
        way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the
        sample files as a guide.

          >CSS</a
        >to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece
        (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your
        <u>CSS</u> file to a web server under your control.

        to use it we will download it and place it on our server.

        <h3>BENEFITS</h3>
        <br />
        Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all
        refer to showing people how amazing <u>CSS</u> really can be. This site
        serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web today,
        learning tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future
        techniques we can all look forward to.

        <h3>REQUIREMENTS</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Where possible, we would like to see mostly <u>CSS 1 & 2</u> usage.
          <u>CSS 3 & 4</u> should be limited to widely-supported elements only,
          or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about
          functional, practical <u>CSS</u> and not the latest bleeding-edge
          tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real
          requirement we have is that your <u>CSS</u> validates.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have
          implemented CSS by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see
          fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the
          sheer number of user agents on the web these days — especially when
          you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible
          across every platform. That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can.
          Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome,
          Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright
          laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to
          incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We’re
          well past the point of needing another garden-related design.

          This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain

            >submission guidelines</a

          identical to the one on this site so that others may learn from your
